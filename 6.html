  <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of hte World Wide Web, alongside HTML and  JavaScript. [2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. [3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate. CSS file, and reduce complexity  and repetition in the structural content.</p>
